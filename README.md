# HandIn5 WebSockets/Real Time Communication

=======================================================================================================================================
1. Name attributes of HTTP protocol makes it difficult to use for real time systems.
=======================================================================================================================================

=======================================================================================================================================
2. Explain polling and long-polling strategies, their pros and cons.
=======================================================================================================================================
  Polling is when the client request is made via a normal HTTP request, which is then processed by the server. 
Although the request might only be done once polling will make sure to execute certain requests at a certain 
time interval. The goal of this being that the server and client remain up to date, making a real time system. 
The thing with polling being that the connection between client and server is maintained. A new 
connection is made with the server when polling is initiated.

HTTP Long-polling is a technique used to push updates to a web client. A connection is held open between the web client and the web server so that when the server has new information it can push it to the client. That connection is then closed. A new connection is then established between the client and the server and then wait for another update from the server.

  but more widely accepted for browsers.

======================================================================================================================================= 3. What is HTTP streaming, SSE (Server sent events)?
=======================================================================================================================================
 When communicating using SSEs, a server can push data to your app whenever it wants, without the need to make an initial request. In other words, updates can be streamed from server to client as they happen. SSEs open a single unidirectional channel between server and client.
=======================================================================================================================================
4. What is WebSocket protocol, how is it different from HTTP communication, what advantages it has over
HTTP?
=======================================================================================================================================
Websocket is alternative for http communication. Main differences is that it is full duplex and uses single TCP connection. Does not use http request, response pattern. Websockets are widely used in realtime comunication systems. Websockets are bi-directional. 
=======================================================================================================================================
5. Explain what the WebSocket Protocol brings to the Web-world.
=======================================================================================================================================
Full duplex Communication - bi-directional communication between the server and the client. Better efficency, less traffic load.
Faster communication between client and server.
=======================================================================================================================================
6. Explain and demonstrate the process of WebSocket communication - From connecting client to server,
through sending messages, to closing connection.
=======================================================================================================================================

 Client makes http request to server. An upgrade header is included that tells to server that clients wants to establish websocket connection.

Initial websocket request:

GET ws://websocket.example.com/ HTTP/1.1
Origin: http://example.com
Connection: Upgrade
Host: websocket.example.com
Upgrade: websocket

 If the server supports the WebSocket protocol, it agrees to the upgrade and communicates this through an Upgrade header in the response. So then handshake is made between client and server.

server response:

HTTP/1.1 101 WebSocket Protocol Handshake
Date: Wed, 16 Oct 2013 10:07:34 GMT
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: WebSocket

 Now that the handshake is complete the initial HTTP connection is replaced by a WebSocket connection that uses the same underlying TCP/IP connection. At this point either party can starting sending data (messages etc.)

 Messages can be sent via

7. What's the advantage of using libraries like Socket.IO, Sock.JS, WS, over pure WebSocket libraries in the
backend and standard APIs on frontend? Which problems do they solve?
=======================================================================================================================================

=======================================================================================================================================
8. What is Backend as a Service, Database as a Service, why would you consider using Firebase in your
projects?
=======================================================================================================================================
BaaS is a model for providing web and mobile app developers with a way to link their applications to backend cloud storage and APIs exposed by back end applications while also providing features such as user management, push notifications, and integration with social networking services.
  
=======================================================================================================================================
9. Explain the pros & cons of using a Backend as a Service Provider like Firebase.
=======================================================================================================================================

=======================================================================================================================================
10. Explain and demonstrate “three-way data binding” using Firebase and Angular.
=======================================================================================================================================

=======================================================================================================================================
11. Explain and demonstrate the difference between the simple chat system in your own WebSocket + Node.js
backend vs. Firebase.
